# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

## Overview
- This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data using SQL queries, focusing on understanding the impact of the pandemic on Australia and comparing it with global trends. By examining key metrics such as cases, deaths, testing rates, vaccination coverage, and government response measures, the analysis seeks to provide insights into the progression of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

## Data Source
- The COVID-19 data used in this analysis is sourced from ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and government response measures from various countries and regions. The data is regularly updated and maintained to provide accurate and reliable information for analysis.

## Analysis Scope
- The analysis covers COVID-19 data for Australia, with comparisons to global trends and other continents where applicable. The period spans from the onset of the pandemic to the most recent available data. Key metrics are analyzed over time to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.

## SQL Queries
1. Total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in Australia
- This query displays the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Australia over time, along with the death percentage relative to the total cases.
2. Comparison of Australia's Total Cases and Deaths per Million to Global Average
- This query compares Australia's total cases and deaths per million to the global average, providing insights into the severity of the pandemic in Australia compared to other countries.
3. Percentage of Population Infected in Australia
- This query calculates the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in Australia over time, shedding light on the extent of virus transmission within the population.
4. ICU Patients and Hospitalized Patients per Million in Australia
- This query analyzes the average number of ICU patients and hospitalized patients per million people in Australia over time, assessing the strain on healthcare resources during the pandemic.
5. Reproduction Rate in Australia compared to the Global Average
- This query compares the reproduction rate (R-value) of COVID-19 in Australia to the global average, indicating the rate of virus transmission within the population.
6. Impact of Vaccination on Cases and Deaths in Australia
- This query examines the impact of vaccination on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Australia, providing insights into the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.
7. Governmental Policies and Interventions in Australia
- This query investigates how governmental policies and interventions have affected the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, assessing the effectiveness of public health measures.
8. Comparison of Australia's Testing Rate with Other Continents
- This query compares Australia's testing rate for COVID-19 with other continents, highlighting differences in testing strategies and capabilities.
9. Vaccination Coverage in Australia Compared to Other Continents
- This query evaluates Australia's vaccination coverage (people vaccinated per hundred) compared to other continents, providing insights into global vaccination efforts.
10. Stringency Index in Australia compared to Global Average
- This query compares Australia's stringency index (a measure of pandemic response measures) to the global average, assessing the rigor of government interventions.

## SQL Components
1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- CTEs are used to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within a query. They improve query readability and maintainability by breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable parts.
2. Subqueries
- Subqueries are nested queries used within another query to retrieve data or perform calculations. They are often used to filter or aggregate data based on specific conditions.
3. Aggregation Functions
- Aggregation functions like AVG(), ROUND(), and MAX() perform calculations on groups of rows to generate summary statistics such as averages, totals, or maximum values.
4. Window Functions
- Window functions like LAG() are used to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. They are particularly useful for analyzing trends over time or calculating running totals.
5. Joins
Joins combine data from multiple tables based on a related column between them. Inner joins, in particular, retrieve only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
6. Conditional Logic
- Conditional logic, such as CASE statements, is used to perform different actions based on specified conditions. This is useful for categorizing data or performing calculations based on specific criteria.
7. Type Casting
Type casting, using functions like CAST(), converts data from one data type to another. This is often necessary when performing calculations involving different data types.
8. Mathematical Calculations
- Mathematical calculations, such as calculating percentages or rate changes, are performed using arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and mathematical functions like ROUND().
9. Data Filtering
- Data filtering is performed using the WHERE clause to select rows that meet specific criteria, such as filtering data for a particular country or date range.
10. Data Sorting
- Data sorting is performed using the ORDER BY clause to arrange query results in a specified order, such as sorting by date in ascending or descending order.

## Key Findings
- Summary of the key insights derived from the analysis, including notable trends,

## Future Work
1. Explore additional variables or data sources to enhance the analysis.
2. Conduct comparative analyses with other countries or regions.
3. Refine existing queries to uncover deeper insights into the pandemic's impact.

## Conclusion
- By analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL, we can gain valuable insights into the pandemic's impact on Australia and its response compared to global trends. These insights can inform public health strategies and contribute to better understanding and management of future health crises.
